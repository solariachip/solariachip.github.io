(in experimentation: majority is written in blank verse)

Burgeoned lands bravely \
Threshed by seas \
Full bright drops \
Makes this pebble \
Stone blue 

You were born too \
And we met at canopy \
Rooted with the ancient ones \
Posthumous fibers binding petrified thoughts 

A common chapter \
In which one narrative nascent \
Cloying in darkness and fear \
Foils the life pouring forth

If thinking is evidence \
Wretchedness should be adequate \
To make parallel wakes; \
Small ripples of sequestered humanity

Surrounded by the sea, \
A lone wave \
Constructed and destructed each time \
Pushes the Earth aside \
Refining bare minerals and leaving naught
