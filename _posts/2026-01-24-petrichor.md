In a land I was formed \
Surrounded by the sea \
The one that makes this pebble \
Stone blue 

You were born too \
And maybe we met under a canopy \
Swaying with the ancient ones \
Posthumous fibers binding petrified thoughts 

A common chapter \
In which one narrative nascent \
Cloying in darkness and fear \
Foils the life pouring forth

If thinking is evidence \
Wretchedness should be adequate \
To make parallel wakes \
Small ripples of sequestered humanity

Surrounded by the sea, \
A lone wave \
Constructed and destructed each time \
Pushes the Earth aside \
Refining bare minerals and leaving naught
