At the end of this month Solaria Chip is heading to the dance floor at [Tacoma Dome](https://www.tacomadome.org) to watch [REZZ](https://www.officialrezz.com) make history as its first female electronic DJ to headline at this major venue. The Ukranian-Canadian DJ and producer, née Isabelle Rezazadeh, is one of our all-time favorite artists known for her midtempo bass-driven tracks that reverberate throughout your bones. From intro to finish, her songs demonstrate precision, prowess, and prolific originality. Dark and industrial, REZZ deliberates every beat with exquisite tension drawn out into a phantasmagorical drop in hypnotizing harmony. In concert, her melodies are complimented by tenebrous visual elements for a truly cinematic and complete experience. REZZ has already made history at other venues and events like Coachella, where she was the first female DJ to headline the Sahara Stage and hosted [Red Rocks Amphitheatre’s first all-female lineup](https://www.redrocksonline.com/events/rezz-rocks-vi-526736/). I’ve attended 3 of her diversity of performances at festivals in Socal all the way to Maryland (Carli and I also both had tickets to her Brooklyn Mirage performance but regrettably missed it!), and most recently to her sold out [debut Portal show at the Cow Palace](https://www.cowpalace.com/event/rezz-presents-portal/) in March. This talented and underrated artist never fails to put on an unforgettable mind-melting performance every time. 

REZZ began uploading her music to Soundcloud in 2015 and soon after caught the attention of EDM icons Skrillex (read [More here](https://solariachip.com/More/)) and deadmau5. Her debut EP “[*Insurrection*](https://soundcloud.com/official-rezz/sets/rezz-insurrection-ep-nest-hq)” was released on [Owsla’s](https://owsla.com)/Nest HQ’s imprint and quickly dubbed by [MTV as “the new queen of the dark techno scene”](https://web.archive.org/web/20151106160249/http://www.mtv.com/news/2371017/rezz-queen-of-the-dark-scene/). The following year in 2016, she released “*[The Silence is Deafening](https://soundcloud.com/official-rezz/sets/the-silence-is-deafening-ep)*” championing the [mau5trap](https://mau5trap.com) imprint and many other tracks after; collaborating with deadmau5 himself to create a *tour de force* like [Hypnocurrency](https://rezzmau5.ffm.to/hypnocurrency) that reflect her distinctive style. She is lauded in Canada where she grew up as one of its top artists, having won the [Juno Award for the Electronic Album of the Year](https://junoawards.ca/awards/winners-nominees/) twice in [2018](https://junoawards.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Winners-list.pdf) and [2020](https://junoawards.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2020-JUNO-Awards-EN.pdf). With soaring success, she launched her label [HypnoVizion Records](https://www.hypnovizion.com) to gather other talented artists pushing the boundaries of the electronic genre. Her fourth album, “*Can You See Me?*” boasts some of her [“heaviest tracks”](https://edm.com/news/rezz-announces-release-date-new-album-can-you-see-me/) to date, emphasizing deep bass knockouts layered effortlessly with sweeping synths for a spellbinding sound. REZZ [posted](https://x.com/OfficialRezz/status/1767935539188048123) candidly on social media prior to its release that it’s “just all hard as fuck. My favorite project ever, perfectly aligned to my current tastes.” REZZ’s music truly sets a precedent for sheer novelty in a genre as saturated as EDM. As a leading midtempo pioneer, REZZ continues to challenge and develop the music scene with her upcoming releases. 

For many of her devoted fans including Carli and I, REZZ is an inspiration and a monolith of experimentation and taking big risks with her music and shows. Her discography boasts major reception and recognition, with every track a testament to her unstoppable dynamic and musical genius. She encourages budding DJs and producers to put out as much music as they can while staying true to their own style. REZZ is not one to be influenced by the demand for faster BPM or a predictable drop imposed by a majority of the EDM audience. Across many [interviews](https://www.cbc.ca/music/rezz-canadian-electronic-music-producers-1.7063050#:~:text=The%20thing%20Rezz%20sees%20as,not%20I%20even%20get%20paid.%22), REZZ states that she makes music for the love of it: she “would do this for free forever”. Her passion and vision is evident in her bangers, as she blazes forward into the year with new projects.

Her fifth album, “*As The Pendulum Swings*” is set to release this Friday, September 12th just two weeks before her biggest event ever at Tacoma Dome. After seeing her first [Portal](https://rezzportal.com) show at the Cow Palace, the bar has never been higher for musical performances across all genres. Personally, that performance has beat out mainstream and top-chart musicians I’ve see all over the world. Posted by the left-side speaker and surrounded by strangers-to-friends, the Portal experience was aptly named as I was transported to another dimension of spine-chilling and filthy beats while gazing into discombobulated eyeballs, haunted hallways, and her iconic spiral motifs set ablaze by enormous pyrotechnics displays. I expect her show at the Dome will pass on the crown as my next favorite performance augmented by her exciting upcoming album release.
